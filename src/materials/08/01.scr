WHERE SHOULD I START WITH?

Let's start with CPU-I/O bursts. CPU/I-O bursts are basically what happened
continually in the PC of yours that you are currently using right now. Each
cycle consists of, well, a CPU burst and an I/O burst.

A CPU burst happens when the CPU is processing something, even small
processes that may seem instant. While an I/O burst happen when the CPU is
waiting for I/O. For this material about scheduling, we're concerned about
the CPU burst.
